## About the Task.
npm start - runs the app

I sorted the data by projects and employees working on these projects. After that I coupled those employees without any duplication. In the end I reseived an arrey holding objects : {projectId: id, pairs: an array holding two employees worked on that project, status: of the project(done or still active). I used the status in another table. I've decided to make a bit more complecx app, so I put some more statistics in the app and more functionality, since you gave us no bounderies for the App.

 When the correct file is uploaded you can see the data on the screen and filter/search through it for a specific employee or project.If you forgot to choose a filter where to search an message will pop up. With the refresh button on the bottom you will be back to the "uploading a file" stage. Click on the sign STATISTICS you will be routed to another page with 4 choices of statistics:
 1. Showing the pairs whorking longest together on a project - this is our TASK!
 2. Showing the projects by the working period.
 3. Showing the count of Employees working on the projects.
 4. Showing the working progress of the employees.

After every statistic there is a button "Export CSV". By click on it you can export the table you see on the screen in SCV file(excel).
